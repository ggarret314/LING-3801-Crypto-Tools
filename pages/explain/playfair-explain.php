	The Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 letter grid to encipher bigrams. The cipher is slightly distructive, 
	as it requires all i's and j's in the plaintext to be combined. Due to the constraints of the course, we can be
	certain there will always be a key phrase at the beginning, after which follows the remaining letters in alphabetical
	order.
