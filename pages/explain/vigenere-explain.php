	The Vigenere cipher works by taking a plain text and enciphering each letter by a particular shift cipher indicated by a key.
	The cryptanalysis involves checking for repeated sequences of letters. A more advanced cryptanalysis involves calculating

	the key length. This method can also be applied to calculate the values of the key with some success.
